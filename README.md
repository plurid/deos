Plurid-inspired deOperating System


## Concept

In the browser, on a "native" program, or on a raw machine, connect to an API (e.g., `api.plurid.com`) which will render all the user files (stored locally or not) on planes, where each plane is an instance of an operating system (virtually, any kind of operating system).
